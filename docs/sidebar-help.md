# Sidebar and Help

Clicking (or tapping) on the ![menu](_media/icons/Menu.svg ':class=mdicon
:no-zoom') symbol ❶ to the left of the application bar opens the so-called
"sidebar" with several navigation options.

You can close the sidebar by either clicking or tapping on the ![left
chevron](_media/icons/ChevronLeft.svg ':class=mdicon :no-zoom') symbol ❷ in the
top-right corner of it or by simply clicking or touching outside the sidebar.

On touch enabled devices you can also open the sidebar by swiping from the left,
and close it by either tapping outside the sidebar or swiping it back to the
left.

The "Help" item ❸ shows a multi-chapter help about the user interface and the
displayed discovery information.
